## 📦 FINAL APK DETAILS
- **File**: `github-copilot-cli-v3.2.3-MULTI-FIX-FINAL-20251003_155606.apk`
- **Size**: 7.2MB
- **Version**: 3.2.3 (Build 35)
- **SHA256**: Available in `.sha256` file

## ✅ CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED

### 🔧 Server Delete Functionality (FIXED ✅)
**Issue**: Server deletion was failing in the multi-server management page.

**Root Cause**: Race condition and improper UI update handling in the delete process.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **ServerConfigManager.deleteServer()**: 
  - Added proper validation and error checking
  - Improved active server handling when deleted server is active
  - Added immediate commit() instead of apply() for critical data
  - Added verification that deletion actually occurred
- **ServerAdapter.updateServers()**:
  - Enhanced data change notification logic
  - Added specific handling for deletions vs additions vs modifications
  - Improved UI refresh mechanisms
- **ServerManagementActivity.deleteServer()**:
  - Added background thread processing to prevent UI blocking
  - Enhanced error handling and user feedback
  - Force RecyclerView adapter refresh after deletion
  - Improved loading dialogs and success messages

**Testing**: Build successful, delete functionality should now work properly.

### 🌙 Dark Mode Flicker Issue (FIXED ✅)
**Issue**: Dark mode switching caused severe UI flickering making the app unusable.

**Root Cause**: Static `isThemeApplied` variable in ThemeManager caused conflicts between activities.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **ThemeManager.kt**:
  - Removed problematic static `isThemeApplied` variable
  - Simplified theme application logic
  - Added immediate commit() for theme preferences
  - Removed unnecessary complexity in theme state management
- **SettingsActivity.kt**:
  - Removed unnecessary `resetThemeState()` call in onDestroy()
  - Improved theme switching flow

**Testing**: Theme switching should now be smooth without flicker.

### 📈 Version Management (UPDATED ✅)
**Changes**:
- Updated `build.gradle`: `versionCode 35`, `versionName "3.2.3"`
- Updated `AboutActivity.kt`: Version display shows "3.2.3 (Build 35)"
- All version references are now consistent
